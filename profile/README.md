## Hi there! 👋

🚀 **Betwixt Labs** is a startup focused on revolutionizing the way applications communicate. We strongly believe that developers should never have to compromise on an ergonomic experience to enjoy the benefits of binary serialization. Additionally, we are firm believers that remote procedure calls (RPC) should be as easy as writing a local function.

🔬 That's why building our flagship projects:
- [Bebop](https://github.com/betwixt-labs/bebop) 🎷 - a modern, high-performance binary serialization library enabling blazing fast, typesafe binary serialization without ceremony. 
- [Tempo](https://github.com/betwixt-labs/tempo) 🥁 - a cutting-edge RPC framework that simplifies distributed application development with real-time, end-to-end typesafe APIs.

💡 Our mission is to empower developers like you to build amazing applications with ease. Whether you're working on a real-time chat application, a microservices architecture, or any other distributed system, Bebop and Tempo are here to make your life easier.
